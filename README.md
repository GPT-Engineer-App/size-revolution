The 'MySize' mobile application aims to revolutionize the way users manage and share their clothing sizes. Featuring social media login for easy access, profile management for various clothing sizes, and private sections for sensitive size data, it enhances privacy and user interaction. Key functionalities include size sharing and requests with message and note options, public profile customization for size visibility, and integration of 3D interactive models for a visual sizing experience. The UI focuses on slick, professional design with intuitive navigation and modern 3D graphics. This project will also cover testing phases, development environment setup, and deployment instructions for live user feedback.
